# Chain of Responsibility Pattern in C#

## Introduction
The Chain of Responsibility pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to send a command without knowing which object will handle it. It is part of the Gang of Four design patterns and is particularly useful for building a pipeline of processing units where a request passes through each unit, getting processed along the way.

This pattern decouples the sender and receiver of a request. This is achieved by having a chain of objects, each of which can handle the request or pass it along to the next object in the chain.

## Implementation in C#
In C#, the Chain of Responsibility pattern can be implemented using abstract classes or interfaces. Each handler in the chain inherits from a common interface or abstract class, ensuring they all implement the method to process requests.

### Handler Interface
The handler interface defines a method for processing requests and setting the next handler in the chain.

```csharp
public interface IHandler
{
    void SetNext(IHandler handler);
    void HandleRequest(Request request);
}
```

### Concrete Handlers
Each concrete handler implements the `IHandler` interface. It decides whether to process the request or pass it along to the next handler.

```csharp
public class ConcreteHandlerA : IHandler
{
    private IHandler _nextHandler;

    public void SetNext(IHandler handler)
    {
        _nextHandler = handler;
    }

    public void HandleRequest(Request request)
    {
        if (CanHandle(request))
        {
            // Process the request
        }
        else if (_nextHandler != null)
        {
            _nextHandler.HandleRequest(request);
        }
    }

    private bool CanHandle(Request request)
    {
        // Logic to determine if this handler can process the request
    }
}

public class ConcreteHandlerB : IHandler
{
    // Similar implementation as ConcreteHandlerA
}
```

### Client Code
The client sets up the chain and initiates the request.

```csharp
class Client
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var handlerA = new ConcreteHandlerA();
        var handlerB = new ConcreteHandlerB();

        handlerA.SetNext(handlerB);

        var request = new Request(); // Request should be defined appropriately
        handlerA.HandleRequest(request);
    }
}
```

## Example Scenario
Imagine a logging system where a request (log message) can be handled at different levels (e.g., INFO, DEBUG, ERROR). Each level in the logging hierarchy acts as a handler, deciding whether to log the message or pass it to a more detailed logger.

## Conclusion
The Chain of Responsibility pattern is a powerful tool for creating flexible and maintainable software. By separating the sender and receiver, it simplifies code dependencies and enhances the potential for code reuse.
